First thing first, let be clear what your interest is !!

Be assured, what actually the role of developer, engineer, tester or devops. How they all are different from one another!

I will try to justify all the roles with their responsibilities, what their current scenario is, how much you will gain, and the pain. *Being front-end developer or full stack developer, project engineer or CTO, AWS architect or serverless engineer is beyond this discussion.* As of now, we're just discussing, whether you're a developer or just a geek or beyond these two.

### Developer, right?

The one who, writing efficient code with best practices, can learn & move to varieties of languages as the project required. Developers tend to be more creative-minded in applying patterns to code, learned by self practices or courses, or various aspects of the development life-cycle including reading blogs or forums. Also, working closely with web designers and team-up with other programmers to ship the final project.

In short, developers are responsible for the _entire development process_.

### Or, being an engineer?

The difference between engineer and developer begins with job function. As simple as, any day laborer ( `sorry :'(` ) who currently building a home can't be a civil engineer, who actually planned & designed it, full proofed its architecture. An engineer’s core focus lies within the architecture, designing and planning who had _applied scientific methods_.

Researching or inspiring from different software programs, managing software documentation, contingency plans in case the application failure, maintaining and ensure scalability/enhancing of the application once built. The difference between both is easily distinguishable by their role and the tasks they perform in the development life-cycle.

### Born to break stuff's, I mean just for fun?

Few professionals believe that tester's role no longer needed, as developers can test their own code because it was written by them and they know it well, why that piece of code was written, agree?

This belief is false. Why? Because, the developer having a lack of the tester’s strategy, perspective, and his mindset. Even though mutually their role is same & have a common goal, _to creates a stable application without any bugs_.

In software development life-cycle, developers have responsibilities to complete assigned tasks by following best practices, but sometimes their self-made logic may fail to fulfill project stability/scalability requirements and hence, testers involves in the process. Their sole aim to find flaws and vulnerabilities in the application.

Like frontend & backend developers, testers too have a wide range of domains. Functionality, Usability, Database, Interface, Compatibility, Performance, and Security Testing is a few of them.

& hottest job position in the testing domain is SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test), a blend of the developer as well as a tester who has exposure to complete project management as well as development life-cycle, hence SDET can automate the acceptance test by leveraging their coding skills. That way, they can influence the development, management & design teams on technical implementation and various user scenarios.

### Or, loves to develop & deploy?

DevOps is a culture not a particular team member's role, which promotes collaboration between **DEV**elopment and **OP**eration**S** team to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way.

It is different from traditional IT/Sys-admins. Life-cycle in devops has these process: Development, Testing, Integration, Deployment & Monitoring.

In short, DevOps guys have to analyze, design and evaluate & execute automation scripts so it allows agile development teams to implement _Continuous Integration_ and _Continuous Delivery_. This concept of DevOps helps them to ship products faster, stable in production. It is absolutely necessary to automate all the testing processes and configure them to achieve speed and agility. As we know, manual code deployment leads to human errors in production.

Somewhere I found while researching for DevOps to define for you guys, "`DevOps is a little tricky to define, just like its older brother Agile.`"

Hope you at least got brief understanding, exactly which role meant for what. Hey there, let me know, which role is justifying your skills or where you are currently heading to? and I also hope, I'm able to succeed in clarification & justify with the role & responsibilities with my words as mentioned respectively.

We had only talked about developer life here, whereas there is more thrill in non-developer's life `I Guess`.

Let's dig into next post, what you should explore or at least give a try, to one of the mentioned non-developer skills here.
